# My Wardrobe - An app that stores your warbrobe contents and outfit creater

---

## Brief

The aim for this individual project is to make a CRUD app with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all the core modules I covered during my first five weeks of training with QA in their 12 weeks DevOps Bootcamp 2021. A CRUD app has Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality.

Requirements for this project are as follows;

- Functioning CRUD application created in Python
- Trello board with expansion on user stories, use cases and to-do lists
- ERD and pipeline diagrams
- Relational  database with at least two tables and a one to many relationship
- Unit testing with Pytest with high test coverage provided
- Flask HTML front-end website and integrated API's
- Git for Version Controle
- Jenkins as a CI server.
- Risk assessments

## My app idea

I have decided to create an app that stores what garments you have in your wardrobe. It will allow users to add different garments with descriptions into the app, they will be able to view all the garments they have entered and delete garments when they no longer wear them. I would also like users to have the ability to create a 'look' complied of different garments. They can use this to save an outfit they really enjoyed as a reference. This app can also help the user while shopping; No more thinking "Do I have something similar?" "What will I wear with this new top?"

I drew inspiration from the 1995 film **Clueless** which features [Cher's Wardrobe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU) With further training, I would love to revisit this project and add the ability to add images.
